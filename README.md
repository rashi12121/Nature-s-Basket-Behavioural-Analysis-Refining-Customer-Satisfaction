# 🛒 Natures Baskit - Order Cancellation & Customer Segmentation Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a detailed data analysis for **Natures Baskit**, a modern grocery delivery service operating across Mumbai. The platform delivers fresh fruits, vegetables, snacks, and beverages directly to customers' doorsteps, aiming to provide a smooth and reliable shopping experience.

As of January 1, 2024, Natures Baskit identified **order cancellations** as a key challenge impacting customer satisfaction and operational efficiency. Additionally, the company expressed a need to better understand the behavior of its **top customers** to offer more personalized services.

To address these needs, this project focuses on two major areas:
1. **Order Cancellation Analysis**
2. **Customer Segmentation and Delivery Behavior**

### 2. Customer Segmentation
- Segment top customers based on their past purchase behaviors and order frequency.
